# DiskonKu Prototype

DiskonKu is a concept prototype for a Jakarta-based platform that helps users:

- Discover verified restaurant deals (not random user uploads)
- Browse promos by popularity, recency, and location
- Join and manage online queues at partner restaurants
- Switch between **Customer** and **Restaurant** modes
- Preview a simple **Restaurant Dashboard** to monitor promo performance and queues

This repository contains a single 'diskonku-eng.html' file that acts as a clickable UI demo for user testing. It is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks) and is designed to be deployed easily with GitHub Pages.
